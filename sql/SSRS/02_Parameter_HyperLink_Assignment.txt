1. Create a Shared Dataset using the following code

select D. DepartmentID, D.Name as DepartmentName, D.GroupName from [HumanResources].[Department] as D 

2. Create a second Shared Dataset using the following code:

select EH.DepartmentID,JobTitle, BirthDate, MaritalStatus, Gender,StartDate, EndDate
from [HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] as EH
join [HumanResources].[Employee] as E
on EH.BusinessEntityID = E.BusinessEntityID
3. Create two new reports, each one using the two new Shared Datasets:

Report 1. Use the fields GroupName and DepartmentName. Include DepartmentID temporarily if you wish to.
Report 2. In the second report, use all of the fields, including DepartmentID temporarily.

4. Link the first report to the second report using a parameter. The two reports should be joined by the DepartmentID field.

In other words, if you click on a row in the first report, the second report should open with all of the relevant rows based on the relevant DepartmentID field.

You should modify the second Shared Dataset to the following:

select EH.DepartmentID,JobTitle, BirthDate, MaritalStatus, Gender,StartDate, EndDate
from [HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] as EH
join [HumanResources].[Employee] as E
on EH.BusinessEntityID = E.BusinessEntityID
where EH.DepartmentID = @paramDepartmentID
