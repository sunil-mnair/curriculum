1. In the second report from the last Practice Activity (which I called PA4_2), add a header and footer:

Include a text box, a picture, a line, and a text box including the page number.

2. Using the shared dataset DataSetPA4-1, add  a drop-down list to the list of parameters. You should use the DepartmentID as the Values, and DepartmentName as the Labels. 

3. Change the second report (PA4_2) to allow multiple values to be selected.

Reminder: you will need to change the SQL code from
where EH.DepartmentID = @paramDepartmentID 
to
where EH.DepartmentID IN (@paramDepartmentID)
